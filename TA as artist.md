@TA as artist
# Tech artist = artist
* historically, this is contentious
* “tech artist = bad artist” meme
* Nod to Renaissance
	* great artists can be cerebral
	* real examples
		* Bay Raitt
		* Scott A
		* Scott S
	* who woud think a painter is not supposed to know paint?
* Still, most of us areb’t gonna be that great
	* that’s OK
	* high art isn’t the only thing going on
* Talking to artists is part of our job
	* Can’t help them if you don’t know them
* Translating for them is key
	* We need to know the language
		* art crit
		* art history
	* but also work life:
	* Production art is different from fine art
		* Social and professional pressures
		* need to observe them first hand
	* best way to do this is to be part of the culture
* For some of us, this means moonlighting regularly
* for some, it means support work
* for some, it’s a phase in our careeer
* No matter what….
	* Don’t lose touch with your artsy side
	* find ways to keep making art
