# FX fundamentals

> go back and look at Julian’s talk; re-read elemental magic

 - time
	* key to all effects
	* hard to imagine a game where all the effects took the exact same time
	* time drives everything
		* most particle systems use lifespan as the key driver
* color
	* often driven by gameplay needs
		* this is a tough art challenge:
			* are there enough primaries? 
			* art they the right primaries
	* Historically, additive (this is changing)
		* visual language of fx is largely defined by what we used to do…
* dynamics
	* how do things interact
		* bounces
		* flows 
		* absorption
		* fields
* particles
	* just a physics hack
		* lots of cheap calculations instead of a few expensive ones
	* goes back to calculus:
		* lots of point samples end up looking like a fluid  system
		*
