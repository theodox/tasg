# History of TA as a discipline
%% this bit lays out the evolution of the discipline, lays the foundation for what we are today
* Why start with history?
	* To illustrate unique, hybrid nature of a TA
	* To underline the different strands of influence
	* To help offer a working definition, since TA is such a fuzzy term.
* The games industry cladogram
	* in the beginning was  programmer
		* then came content specialists
		* then came specialties:
			* art
			* design
		* these split further as jobs get more specialized
		* Common theme: more and more content producers
	* Next gen and the birth of TA
		* big teams, lots of artists
		* productivity more important
		* production too complex to manage by ear
			* “Next Gen bloat”
				* it’s an old story now, but it was a big deal throughout the 00’s
				* Content costs at the beginning of the generation: 500% of what they were for the Xbox/ PS2 gen
				* Bigger teams:
					* bureaucracy
					* loss of personal input
					* risk aversion & sequelitis
			* anecdote: japan
				* bigger team sizes than western devs in the  90’s
				* Craft model, similar to an old animation studio
					* Lots of manual steps
					* Most TA’s were women because it was the lowest end of the totem pole
				* Next gen transition disasters:
					* already big teams became huge
						* FF art director: what do yo need ? A tough guy!
					* Lots of big franchises foundered
* Enter the TA
	* started off informally
		* evolved from 'power users'
		* usually solving problems the rest of the team ignored
	* became more recognized, important
		* Information sharing -- TA's are more vocal than most artists
			* hat tip to TART, TAO
		* growing complexity of 3d demands drives need for workflows
	* became critical
		* Big budgets, big teams put a premium on productivity
		* More specialization in pipelines and line jobs means more need for glue
		* Games are evolving way faster than DCCs; new functionality comes in house more often than it does from ADSK
* Looking ahead:
	* increasing professionalization
		* schools and programs
	* more responsibility
		* Full scale departments
		* Recognized specialty
	* Identity crisis?
		* Will we turn into vanilla programmers?
		* Will we lose touch with our customers?
