%% outline of the preliminary chunk

# Approach
* The goal of the book is to be a snapshot of what TA’s know
	* **To take you from beginner to intermediate** +
		* assumes you know the basics, eg, how to run Max/Maya
	* High level introductions to the major problem sets
	* Framework for tackling problems
	* Practical examples
	* Further reading
* It's not a tutorial book
	* tutorials are easy to find
	* books aren't great for up-to-the minute info
	* But they are great at giving a strategic look at stuff
* Emphasis on survival skills:
	* you can look up technical details...
	* we want to give your the right instincts to know where to look
* Inspiration
	* “Art of Readable Code”
		* real-world examples and advice
		* But no end-to-end implementations
		* Not tied to specific software
	* “Thinking in…”
		* Providing a framework for devising your own answers, not a list of answers

"Enough to be dangerous", or: So, you want to be a TA  
-------------------------  


People have been making art with computers since the 1970s, and it for most of that time computer art has existed in the uneasy relationship between the technology which makes it possible and the creative vision which gives it purpose.  Artists and programmers have their own distinctive cultures, outlooks and skill-sets. Films and games that rely on CG are always the result of  collaboration -- sometimes fruitful, sometimes fraught -- between two  quite self-consciously different groups. 

Occasionally, though, a rare individual will crop up who transcends that division, making art with the artists and code with coders.  These exceptional people are able to do incredible things because they combine the insight and inspirations of art with the power of tech to create rich, complex works that seem too ambitious for a single individual [](a named example would be good here)

However, they aren't us. 

Or, at least, the business card or resume of these extraordinary folks is not much more likely to read "technical artist" than anything else.  The true Renaissance individual is a rarity: like being a "genius," to be "multi-talented" is personal and not a departmental quality (and yes, all you engineers -- that means you're _not_ the department of genius. Sorry).  

Tech art is _not_ what you get when you mix art and technology.  It's a discipline with it's own unique skills and goals. It's important to remember that, because one of the chief hazards of our trade is the inverse of the Renaissance archetype: the old stigma of being "Jack of all trades, master of none."  

I used to work along the route of the Seattle Ducks, a business that ferried tourists around the city in WWII vintage landing craft so they could see the sights from both land and sea.  These things would trundle by every hour, full of tourists with duck-quacking noisemakers, so I grew to hate them passionately. The eponymous vehicle, the DUKW -- originally built for a planned invasion of Holland -- is an awkward and ungainly vehicle: it's not a very handy boat, nor is it a particularly comfortable or maneuverable bus.  It's sort of impressive that it works at all, but if you judge the DUKW by how it performs as a boat or as a land vehicle it comes off looking faintly absurd.

Is that a metaphor for technical art? Well, yes - but not the metaphor you might expect.  

The fact is, the DUKW is not an awkward compromise between boat and bus: _it's a landing craft_.  It was designed to carry soldiers and cargo onto a hostile shore, to ford rivers and carry cargo when the bridges have all been blown.  It's very good at what it's designed to do: the fact that it happens to look like the ungainly crossbreed of two other things is an accident of circumstance. Try driving your Tesla across Lake Union some day and you'll develop some respect for the designers of the DUKW.

So, _there_ is the metaphor: Despite the hybridized name, and despite the somewhat murky definition of what we do, tech artists are  a breed of our own, not just a frankensteined hybrid of artists and technologists.  We share skills and interests with programmers, and we know the language and concerns of artists, but the similarities between what we do and what our teammates do are often more apparent than real.  If you conceive of what we do as just the pro-sumer version of what they do, we look like the DUKWs: as unhappy compromises. When you see us as a unique -- if still evolving -- discipline with a unique mission you can judge us by how well we fulfill that role, and not merely by how well we approximate the skills of others.

Of course, that begs the question of what our mission actually is.  It can be hard to deduce if you merely look at our daily activities: we do a bewildering variety of task using a wide array of tools, from Max and Maya to C++ and SQL.  What binds the character rigger and the effects artist, the folks who write modeling scripts and the ones who manage polygon budgets?

What we share -- the thing that makes us technical artists, and not just a collection of scripters, riggers and problem-solvers, is dedication to _improving the relationship between art and technology_. 

Its certainly a relationship that can benefit from a little couples therapy. Technology is a frustrating mixture of radical empowerment and humiliation. Computers give artists amazing powers -- but, like the wishes in a fairy tale those powers often come with a hidden catch: "Of course you can have realistic hair simulation for your character!" says the mighty genie, "You merely have to set these 17 different sliders that control the Verlet strand interpolation, anisotropic specularity, and keratin distribution functions. And I did mention that was for every strand, yes? Your wish is my command!"

Our job is simply to tame the technical and organizational obstacles that always come up when computers are involved so that our teams can focus on making stories, characters and settings that connect with people.  One day that might mean writing artist-friendly tools, but the next day it can mean hosting a brown-bag lunch to keep your teammates caught up on the latest graphics tech.  Sometimes, helping the art team means lobbying the programmers for new features; sometimes it means fighting to head off a plan that will sacrifice artistic creativity on the altar of technical expediency.  All of our skills -- artistic and technical, but also social and organizational -- are just tools for achieving the real goal: which is to liberate artistic endeavors from the technical trivia and clerical drudgework that computers are constantly trying to impose.
