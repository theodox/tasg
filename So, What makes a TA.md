# So, What makes a TA?
 - Bring it back together: what do all TA's share?
	* DCC wizardry
		* More than one package
		* need to see the answers multiple times to judge them
		* Good eye for little known features
			* Often your team isn’t the only one with a particular need
			* But frequently production artists are too focused on perfecting their craft to know the nooks and crannies of their tools
			* TA usually makes a hobby of poking at all those menu items that nobody knows about
	* practical production experience
		* Fluency with content tools 
		* Understanding how they fit into the larger picture
			* It’s not uncommon for different teams to use the tools in completely different ways
			* It’s critical to see it all from end to end
		* need to know the way art communities use tools
			* listen to other users
			* watch own patterns
	* scripting
		* Languages.... 
		*  = which really means 'python' most of the time
		* 'real' programming a plus, but secondary
	* 3d math and concept 
		* Because TA concern goes beyond the visuals into the underlying structure of a project, it’s important to understand the basics 
		* ++ xref to chapter++
*  TA as artists
	* Don't have to be a genius, but you do have to be competent
		* need to be able to explain why some limitations are more important than others to programmers
		* this is easier if you know the frustrations at first hand, not just relaying them
	* Need to understand what other artists see and say
* process vision
	* always look at how things are done and could be better
	* learn to spot problems before they become routines
	* dedication to making things better over time, not just today
