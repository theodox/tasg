I@: preface outline

%% outline of the preliminary chunk

# Approach
* The goal of the book is to be a ready reference for working TA
	* Intermediate to advanced
		* assumes you know the basics
	* High level introductions to the major problem sets
	* Framework for tackling problems
	* Practical examples
	* Further reading
* It's not a tutorial book
	* tutorials are easy to find
	* books aren't great for up-to-the minute info
	* But they are great at giving a strategic look at stuff
* Emphasis on survival skills:
	* you can look up technical details...
	* we want to give your the right instincts to know where to look
* Inspiration
	* “Art of Readable Code”
		* real-world examples and advice
		* But no end-to-end implementations
		* Not tied to specific software
	* “Thinking in…”
		* Providing a framework for devising your own answers, not a list of answers
